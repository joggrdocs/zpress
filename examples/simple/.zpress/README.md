# .zpress

This directory is managed by zpress. It contains the
materialized documentation site — synced content, build artifacts, and static assets.

| Directory   | Description                                    | Tracked |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `content/`  | Synced markdown pages and generated config     | No      |
| `public/`   | Static assets (logos, icons, banners)           | Yes     |
| `dist/`     | Build output                                   | No      |
| `cache/`    | Build cache                                    | No      |

## Commands

```bash
zpress sync    # Sync docs into content/
zpress dev     # Start dev server
zpress build   # Build static site
```

> **Do not edit files in `content/`** — they are regenerated on every sync.
> Edit the source markdown in your workspace packages instead.
